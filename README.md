### Applications
* Dynamic Map Updates: Integrating traffic sign detection models with GPS systems allows for dynamic updating of maps, incorporating real-time traffic sign information, which can guide drivers more accurately.
* Integrated Traffic Systems: Traffic sign detection models can be part of a broader smart city initiative, where data from various sources, including traffic signs, is used to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion.
* Driver Alerts: Traffic sign detection models are used in ADAS to alert drivers about upcoming traffic signs, such as stop signs or speed limits, which they may have missed. This improves safety by reducing the chances of human error.
* ### Compiler Type:  
I used a compiler GPU provided in google colab while running this project.
